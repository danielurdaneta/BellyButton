# Belly button biodiversity

This project was created by Improbable Beef which looked for subjects with high population of bacteria suitable for synthetic beef production. Using the dashboard page  we can look up differents subjects, see the biodiversity found in their navel, as well as their demographics and their washing frequency. We made it using Javascript, HTML and CSS. 

Following is the link to the dashboard's page:
